## Building docker images
## microservice1
docker image build -t microservice1 .
## microservice2
docker image build -t microservice2 .

## Creating a bridge docker network for inter-networking communication between the two microservices
## Use "docker network ls" to verify that the new network is created successfully
docker network create microservice1-microservice2

## Starting docker container on the bridge network created
### Running the microservice1 on a docker container and exposing port 10091 as
### springboot application is running on port number- 10091
docker container run --network microservice1-microservice2 --name microservice1 -p 10091:10091 -d microservice1

### Running the microservice2 on a docker container and exposing port 10092 as
### springboot application is running on port number- 10092
docker container run --network microservice1-microservice2 --name microservice2 -p 10092:10092 -d microservice2

## Verifying docker container started successfully
docker ps -a
